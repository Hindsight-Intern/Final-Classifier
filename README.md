Final Notebook for this mini project is "Panda Table-checkpoint.ipynb," which will output a data frame that has taken recent articles from CBS News and will label the article with one of the following tags that indicate what main tag the article would fall under.

Tags: ["politics", "international news", "celebrity", "sports", "health", "nutrition", "fitness", "beauty", "business", "economy", "finance", "technology", "science", "lifestyle"]

If the repository is cloned and "guiTable.py" is run locally, then it is possible to filter the resulting data frame produced from "Panda Table-checkpoint.ipynb"
